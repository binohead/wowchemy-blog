I'm terrible at taking notes. But taking good notes is invaluable, throughout any study of animal behaviour. So do as I say, not as I do; hope these tips help.

## Tip 1

Tip 1 is, um, take notes. It's amazing what one forgets, and equally amazing how much one can remember with even just a few written prompts.

## Tip2

Write down everything. Of course, you can't *literally* write down everything, but write down more than you think you need to.

What's important to write down? That's a very individual decision, but some basics are:

- roughly, what were you doing? (watching animals mainly, just hiking?)
- when did these observations happen?
- what was the weather like?
- give a picture, sketched and/or verbal, of the general situation (where the animals were relative to each other and you and the local setting - trees or whatever)

Beyond that, you can take things in all sorts of directions.

## Tip 3

Organize your notes in a way that makes them clear. Again, how you do so depends on your own approach, but it can help to have standard headings, subheadings, columns, etc for particular things.

## Tip 4

Let your notes evolve. At first, they might be quite disorganzied and scruffy, but gradually they get more organized and standardized. That's OK - in fact, that's typical of most note taking, plus it's how studies progress: from open-ended observation to focussed testing of particular predictions. Your notes will, and should, reflect that progression.
