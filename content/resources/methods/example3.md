## Species at risk

The most familiar list of species at risk is the federal one proposed by COSEWIC (the Committee for the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada). But several other lists exist, each with a different emphasis, depending on jurisdiction, geographic coverage, and sources of information.

[Canada Species at Risk Act (SARA)](http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/search/advSearchResults_e.cfm?stype=species&advkeywords=&op=1&locid=9&taxid=2&desid=0&schid=0&)
[Nova Scotia Endangered Species Act](http://www.speciesatrisk.ca/municipalities/sar_ns.htm#BIRDS)
[General Status Ranks](http://myweb.dal.ca/aghorn/conservation/NSranks.html) (for Nova Scotia Environmental Impact Assessments)
[Maritimes list](http://leonardlab.biology.dal.ca/Andy/conservation/MaritimePriority.pdf) (from Partners in Flight)
[Natural Heritage / Conservation Data Centers](http://explorer.natureserve.org/) (Global, G1-5 and Subnational, S1-5)

## Population trends

There's years of data on many species available on the web, collected by various methods and updated constantly. The websites vary in how user-friendly they are, but are enormously distracting once you get the hang of them.

## Conservation plans
