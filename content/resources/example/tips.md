## Get involved

[Nova Scotia Bird Society](http://nsbirdsociety.ca/) Field trips almost every week, public talks almost every month, and more.
[Bird Studies Canada](http://www.bsc-eoc.org/) The home of citizen science in Canada, and the country's authoritative source on all things bird.
[Citizen Science at National Audubon/Cornell](http://www.birdsource.org/) Indispensable source of data, programs, and more for casual bird feeders and experienced ornithologists alike.

## Get a job

[Bird Studies Canada](http://www.bsc-eoc.org/about/jobs/index.jsp?lang=EN) Most require good ID skills, but not always.
[Ornithological jobs](https://www.osnabirds.org/Jobs.aspx) from the Ornithological Societies of North America. Most are seasonal and volunteer, but often very cool.
[WorkCabin Green Career Postings](http://workcabin.ca/) is a general clearinghouse for environmental jobs in Canada.
