Yes, I said to my companion, this is shadbush again.

But no sooner had my statement passed my lips - and the berry pass mine and his - than I realized something was amiss. The leaves were too spiny and rose-like, the berries too clumped.

At the same, an acrid, medicine-like taste infused both our mouths. No, definitely not the serviceberry/juneberry/shadbush/saskatoon that delighted our senses on another recent trip.

I wracked my brains for alternatives, mentally revisiting various tempting berries, like Alder Buckthorn, that had fooled me more than is seemly for a purported naturalist, especially one advising someone who's advising their toddler about what's OK to eat and what's not.

So far, I've settled on some species of *Ilex*, i.e. holly, though I'm not sure what. If it really is that, it comes by its medicinal qualities honestly. I read on wikipedia (where else?) that it's pretty caffeinated, but more interestingly, it turns out that yerba, that plant from which Argentinians make mat√© that the gauchos encountered by Darwin (among others) endlessly sipped, is an *Ilex* too.

Who knew? And who suspected this would all follow from one ill-advised sampling of a plant in a suburban park.
