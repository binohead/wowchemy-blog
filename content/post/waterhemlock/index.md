Until recently, I'd been anxious about the true identity of an umbelliferous plant in our backyard, because it might be water hemlock. A neighbour confirming this i.d., fide a visiting friend, made m worry even more, though I didn't quite give up on our plant, because it just didn't quite fit what the field guides said about water hemlock.

It turned out that the plant was instead the delightful sweet cicely, which I'll feature in another post, perhaps after I make the delicious licorice/anise - like candy from its roots, now that I'm confident it won't kill me.

Never one to be happy for long, though, now that my angst was relieved I was newly anxious (or, technically, eager to the point of anxiety) to see real water hemlock in the flesh. One carrot-like plant after another passed my eyes, but none of them fit the bill, especially the need for the stems to have at least some purplish colour.

Figures that this deadly plant would first appear at a swimming hole we took our grandtoddler ([along Lake Bannook in Dartmouth]()). The miraculous app, iSeek, confirmed it: the very plant, or close to it, that Socrates tanked out on. I checked it out on wikipedia (where else), expecting to find the rumours of its toxicity to be greatly exaggerated, but no, this one's a doozy.
