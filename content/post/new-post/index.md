There's a Gray Catbird in my local patch this winter that everybody sees except me. It's driving me nuts.

But that's what catbirds do. The skulk. They lurk. Now you see them, now you don't. They live up to their name, *Dumetella* (little one of the thorny bushes).

Thus they've appeared throughout the winter now and then, here and there, where they were first spotted in the fall (local readers: these include Point Pleasant Park, Conrose Park, Atlantic Theological Seminary, and lots of rose bushes in Dartmouth).

 This winter's unusual that way because they were everywhere this past falI. I suspect their numbers here were unprecedented.  I tweeted about this last year. Surely you saw the tweet.  It had one of my first gifs, and was vivid and skillfull:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<a href="https://twitter.com/binohead/status/941326567556476933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
 </blockquote>

Why'd that happen? It was a crazy fall for other birds, too, from killdeers to tanagers. Perhaps a topic for another post.
